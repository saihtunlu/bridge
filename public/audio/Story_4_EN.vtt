00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.569
From 2010 to 2015,

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:05.438
I worked as
the Parliament Representative Leader.

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:07.474
There were several times

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:09.109
when men candidates
from my same political party,

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.645
as well as those from other parties
would harass my identity.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.048
For instance, I was called "A Terrorist"

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:17.784
and was paired up
with our party leader

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:22.555
and even with two or three men
that I did not know of.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.624
"This woman has requested
the Parliament

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:26.226
to order everyone
to join military training compulsorily",

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:30.196
a well known publishing company
falsely published it and,

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.866
on social media as well.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.636
I asked the publisher
to take down the false news

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:38.004
instead the company ignored

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.473
and released news
as though it was the truth.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.876
The Parliament never had
a record of that request.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:46.946
Without even investigating
the truth first in the Parliament

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:49.382
I found it excruciating that
a respected publishing company

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.418
would publish disinformation
about me.
