00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.968
During the campaigning period,

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:04.404
we faced a lot of obstacles.

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:06.639
There were places
where we had to travel on foot

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.675
and sometimes late at night

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.211
Some of these places
are not accessible by cars.

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.346
and the journeys were tough

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:14.647
It would take up, not hours,

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:17.150
but an entire day
to get to the destinations.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.918
On top of that,
we had anxiety about the surrounding

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.854
we had to deal with being harassed
and teased during the journey.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.189
It is unsafe
for a woman candidate to travel alone,

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.059
which is why women candidates
need more security services.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:29.963
This also means that
women candidates would require

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.765
higher expenses than men candidates.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.134
During the campaigning period,

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.702
Based on the budget limit,

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.904
women candidates are not allowed
to spend any more than men candidates.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:40.306
women candidates are only allowed
to use limited given amount

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:41.808
For leadership roles and
participation, if

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:44.244
there were more women candidates
with equal opportunities,

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.479
I'm sure the difficulties
that women face

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.248
and our needs would definitely
be more recognised and understood

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.650
Definitely,
everything will be managed well.
