00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.269
In 2015,
I joined the election as an individual.

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:06.940
The leader of the very first party
I was involved in,  was male.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.142
To become a secretary,

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:12.545
I upgraded my skills as if I were a fish
being stuffed for the weighing scales.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:15.615
There was discrimination in the party.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:19.019
During election poll progress,
Women candidates were assigned

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.287
to offer hospitality rather than
giving opportunities in leadership roles.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:24.024
When it came
to choosing constituencies,

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:28.561
men would offer the worst options
to us women candidates.

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.863
There was no security

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.232
and I did not speak
the locals’ language,

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.734
at the end I have become
the only individual.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:37.270
As for my friend,
she was assigned in ethnic minority area,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.541
she faced a language barrier as well.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.410
She has lost points
due to this condition

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.845
and she gradually lost passion
for her goal of becoming
a Parliament Representative.
