WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.568
Based on the percentage of
women candidates

00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:04.004
participating in Parliament Council.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.605
I would like to talk about

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:07.207
the lack of opportunity
for women candidates.

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:11.177
I do not want nor agree
with these restrictions.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.813
When we look
at the population in Myanmar,

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:16.483
over 50 percent of it is women

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:18.084
Based on the population

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:19.386
Women with over 50%
of the population

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:20.720
should be able to participate

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.524
be involved in peacemaking,
security and creating success.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:25.625
In any role or task,

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:28.495
women who take up over 50%
of the country’s population.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.797
should be able to participate
in all aspects of the country.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:34.401
be it economic or political.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.736
Having more women candidates
presenting them in the elections.

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.838
For women to get equal rights

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.707
It is important
so that we can demand more.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.743
People still believe that
we cannot perform well

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:46.279
and that we cannot become leaders.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.948
As we are women candidates

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.350
We get discriminated against

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.186
and have our opportunities
taken away.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:55.155
For opportunities in decision-making

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:58.458
With more number of men candidates
given the power as decision-makers.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:01.227
Loss in opportunities
that women candidates are facing.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.296
they do not take
women’s perspectives and situations.

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:04.497
into consideration completely.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:05.799
By analyzing the actions,

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.469
It is known that laws and policies
established are highly ineffective.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.473
due to a lack of
women candidates’ participation.

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:16.042
This is the loss that our country faces
and will continue to face.
