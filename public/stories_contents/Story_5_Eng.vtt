00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.668
During the 2015 election,

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:03.737
I was one of the female candidates.

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:05.538
During the campaigning period,

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.941
many of us were attacked.

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:09.542
When we were gathering,

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:10.810
our party’s sign boards

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.180
as well as the election sign boards
with my picture were destroyed.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.549
As the election day drew closer,

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:17.951
people from my campaign

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.386
intentionally spread rumours
about me.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:22.389
And made the public
look down on me.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:25.225
Also, women themselves
did not support women candidates.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:28.661
Women, they did not believe
in women candidates.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:29.829
When they voted,

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.998
they assumed men candidates
could lead better than women do.

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.900
Without women’s support,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.168
winning the election
became even more challenging

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:37.003
for the women candidates.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:39.539
Some would not help
the women candidates.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.641
Fearing we might become
better than them.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.376
Such hate

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:46.346
Do not only exist between
men and women candidates.

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.548
Hate are also seen women themselves.

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.418
Women candidates spread
disinformation of one another.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:54.120
And degrade one another.
