00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.268
During 2015 election,

00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:03.670
As a representative of our state

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.805
and as a woman candidate

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.607
I joined the election.

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:09.676
While I was participating
in this election,

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:13.046
I was attacked both as a person
and as a part of a campaign

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:16.049
The fact of being a woman

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.350
Can she even be a leader?

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.652
Will she be able to keep the promises
she will make?

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:22.555
Like always I heard those voices saying

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:26.726
claiming that an authority has been
bribing me to earn more votes.

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:29.696
Other political campaigns
have sued me.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.565
Then “I am working with an authority”

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:36.036
Some have spread
such rumors among the public.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.670
As everyone knows,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.639
Most of the personnels
in the leading positions

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:41.508
in our party are male.

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:43.176
When there are more men candidates

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:45.879
and women involve more in campaigns

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.914
Giving us positions,

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:49.182
inviting us to work together

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:51.551
and then, including us in general

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.853
There are not much opportunities
such as those

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:57.023
For example, when we are travelling
on based on campaign

00:00:57.023 --> 00:01:00.393
Both men and women candidates
have to travel together.

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:01.661
At that time

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.730
Men candidates would neither

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.266
be helping with support

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.803
nor be working together with
women candidates.
