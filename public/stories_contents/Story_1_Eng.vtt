00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.602
I was the very first woman candidate
for representing our party

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:05.271
in the 2015 presidential election.

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:06.439
I received demeaning questions,

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:08.108
like: ”Can a woman
like this really take the role?”

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.477
or “Can she really talk politics

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.379
and leadership alongside
male candidates?”

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.549
Women are rarely given
the opportunity to make decisions

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:21.821
and then discriminated  against
as women when making them

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.591
When we visited the outskirts of the city
during the campaign,

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.626
people threw rocks at our cars

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:30.030
and our number plates were destroyed.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.999
These days on the internet,

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:37.771
I see many instances of hate aimed
at women candidates.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.073
Social media comments like:

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.208
”I want to change as well,
will you marry me?”

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.577
"Is it because
you don’t have a husband yet?"

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:47.047
”Do you think you’re that smart?”

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.149
Needless and hurtful comments.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.285
Some people would create fake accounts
so they could troll me,

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:54.421
sending me rude and
inappropriate photos.
